As we mentioned in [our last blog post](https://blog.datacite.org/datacites-new-membership-model/), DataCite recently changed its membership model, and we now invite members from all types of organisations to join DataCite. As a result, we are happy to announce that several organisations have joined DataCite.  Over the coming months, we will introduce DataCite’s newest members to the community. Today we are introducing you [TIND](http://tind.io), the first for-profit organization to join DataCite -- welcome TIND.

TIND is located in Switzerland and is an official spin-off from the [European Organization for Nuclear Research](http://home.cern) (CERN), providing services for library and data management services based on CERN-developed, open source technology. Established in 2013, TIND provides services to leading research institutions and IGOs such as Caltech and the United Nations.

The TIND Team describes themselves as a “small group with big ambitions.” They are engineers by training but have the mission of libraries at heart.  TIND recognizes that the library mission is to advance knowledge and foster creativity by removing barriers to information, but some of the emerging solutions need to meet these challenges are not widely seen in libraries. 

TIND has a solution, and it involves [Invenio](http://invenio-software.org), a software stack originally developed by CERN to run the [CERN Document Server](http://cds.cern.ch), managing 1.5M bibliographic records in HHigh-Eenergy Pphysics. TIND enjoys an exclusive license agreement with CERN, gaining unique access to Invenio know-how. The TIND Team works closely with the Invenio team, thus always staying up-to-date on new releases, patches on ongoing developments.

As a DataCite member, TIND can immediately enable seamless DOI creation for their partners and customers. DataCite is happy to have TIND join our community, and together we can bring tools and services to the library community. 

In their [press release](http://blog.tind.io/press/partner-datacite), Alexander Nietzold, TIND's CEO says “We’re extremely pleased to be partnering with DataCite [...] Together with DataCite, TIND can offer its customers uniquely citable identifiers for all of their research output.” 

DataCite is extremely happy to welcome TIND to the data publication and citation community! If you want to contact them, you can find all the details in our [DataCite Members page](https://www.datacite.org/members.html).
