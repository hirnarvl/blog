DataCite is a community driven organization, and we encourage involvement from people that share our data sharing vision. Over the past year, DataCite has seen a tremendous amount of growth and uptake in the use of DataCite DOIs. 

To help guide and support our growth and ongoing development, DataCite is forming three new Steering Groups (Sustainability and Business, Services and Technology, and Outreach). Our Steering Groups will provide a venue for open participation by community members and will help us set priorities and identify strategies related to sustainability planning, services, and outreach.

We are seeking recommendations from the community for Steering Group members. Community participation will help us better understand your needs and implement quality services.  

If you are interested in participating in our Steering Groups, please contact patricia.cruse@datacite.org
