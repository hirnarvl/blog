title: Hiring an Application Developer
author: mfenner
---

As DataCite Technical Director I am very excited to announce that DataCite is going to hire an application developer to strengthen the technical team. Working for DataCite is an opportunity for some interesting development work around scholarly infrastructure and data citation. We are a small team, which requires flexibility, but is an opportunity to work on broad range of topics, from frontend development to DevOps work.

We are particularly interested in candidates with a strong Open Science background. Remote work (from somewhere in Europe) is possible.

Please read the job posting for more information and contact me until April 17 if you are interested.
