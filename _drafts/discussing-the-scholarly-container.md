One of my personal highlights in last week's Research Data Alliance (RDA) [6th Plenary Meeting](https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings/rda-sixth-plenary-meeting.html) in Paris was the [Data Packages](https://rd-alliance.org/data-packages-bof-p6-bof-session.html) Birds of the (BoF), organized by [Rufus Pollock](http://rufuspollock.org/) from the Open Knowledge Foundation ([OKFN](okfn.org)). He highlighted the urgent need for packacking data in a standard format to facilitate reuse, and described the extensive work the OKFN has done on [data packages](http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package). A particular focus is on packacking CSV files, the most widely used format for exchanging data.

I was sold on the importance of CSV and the idea of packacking data in a standard format since attending [CSVconf](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2014/05/05/csv-conf-2014.html) in July 2014, and have written about this several times ([Build Roads not Stagecoaches](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/07/18/roads-not-stagecoaches/), [Reference Lists and Tables of Content](/reference-lists-and-tables-of-content/)), most recently a few weeks ago ([Using YAML frontmatter with CSV](/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/)). In the RDA session I suggested two important improvements for the OKFN data package format:

* **Single file.** One very important aspect of packaging is to provide everything in a single file, generated by zipping a folder of multiple files. This pattern has become very common and is used for example for electronic books (`epub`), Microsoft Word documents (`docx`), or [Google Chrome extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging) (`crx`). The [CSVY](http://csvy.org) format that adds a YAML frontmatter for metadata to a CSV file is simplified version of this pattern.

* **Identifier**. The OKFN data package spec uses a `name` attribute to uniquely identify the package. This approach falls short because enforcing the uniqueness of a human readable identifier requires a registry, and this not part of the data package spec. What is needed is a persistent identifier, and DataCite obviously has a lot of experience in this area.

Container-based digital infrastructure is a very hot topic thanks to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker), and it has become clear that tools and workflows are at least as important as the spec for the container itself. If we want to move to scholarly infrastructure based on containers (used here interchangeably with packages), we need registries for these containers that not only provide globally unique identifiers, but also a central index for finding these containers - the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for scholarly containers. DataCite is providing persistent identifiers and standardized metadata for scholarly content with a focus on research data and is therefore in a perfect position to become such a registry. in the RDA session I therefore said that

> I want DataCite to become a registry for data containers

While data, in particular in CSV format, are probably the first and most important use case, containers make sense for all scholarly content, and the DataCite DOIs are used for text documents, images, software, etc. in addition to datasets.
